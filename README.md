# Live Project
Live Project with a team of members using TFS, ASP.NET, C#, and Agile methodologies. 

## Introduction

For my final project at The Tech Academy, I worked with a development team of my peers on a full-scale MVC Job Placement Interface in C# that will be added to the schools LMS(Learning Management Software). It is a web application that is meant to automate applicaiton tracking and hires in the course both to enhance the user experience for future students as well as to help define and manage meaningful data to provide relevant analytics for the school. As a team we shared stories of various difficulty that ranged from backend to front end and UX improvements that needed to be completed. Over the two week sprint I also had the oppertunity to understand the software development lifecycle as well as impliment programming techniques that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects..
